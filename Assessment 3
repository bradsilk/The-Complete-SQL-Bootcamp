/*Complete the following task:

Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: teachers and students.

The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, homeroom_number, phone,email, and graduation year.

The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name,

homeroom_number, department, email, and phone.

The constraints are mostly up to you, but your table constraints do have to consider the following:

 We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency.
 We must have ids as the primary key of the tables
Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual. */

CREATE TABLE students(
	student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name CHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	last_name CHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	homeroom_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	phone VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	graduation_year SMALLINT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE teachers(
	teacher_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name CHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	last_name CHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	homeroom_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	phone VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

/* Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id=1) who has a phone number of 777-555-1234
and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number. */ 

--First, remove NOT NULL email constraint on both tables to be able to complete the task

ALTER TABLE students
ALTER COLUMN email DROP NOT NULL; 

ALTER TABLE teachers
ALTER COLUMN email DROP NOT NULL; 

--Now add info:

phone, 
graduation_year)
VALUES

'Watney',
'5',

); 

SELECT * FROM students;

/* Then insert a teacher names Jonas Salk (teacher_id = 1) 
who as a homeroom number of 5 and is from the Biology department. 
His contact info is: jsalk@school.org and a phone number of 777-555-4321. */

INSERT INTO teachers
